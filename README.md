# Future Portfolio Value

## TODO list

- Sortable table
- Better experience searching coins (maybe debounce it and add Levenshtein)
- Make future value or future market cap editable and all other fields change accordingly
- Persist react query to local storage to avoid hitting the API on every refresh
